Yesterday I was talking with some acquaintances. The topic was how social media can
be a triggering waste of time. "A" said that they like to keep up with their
friends who have moved a way and it is a nice window into their life, which
makes it worth using. "B" said they like to relax and watch cat videos. "B" said
"I hate how it's just, like, cat video, cat video, war and bombs, back to cat
video. But where else can I get my cat videos? And I said, "Probably on
catvideos.com," and then I checked. There is a catvideos.com and it does have
cat videos.

It seems like people have completely forgotten that an internet outside of
TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and the AI summary that appears on the Google search
results page. If they want something, instead of looking for it, they look on
TikTok and hope they have trained their algorithm well enough and followed the
right accounts for it to be delivered to them. They take what it gives. They
have completely forgotten that they have an ability to look for and find what
they want. They just trust media companies to mainline it to their brain.

I guess that's not so different than watching the news and reading Reader's
Digest. But it is. I used to visit many people's blogs daily or more than once a
day, waiting for them to post something new. Following their links to other
blogs. There was no company involved in who they linked to. It was just blogs
they liked. And the average person wrote. Now the average person lets a computer
write for them.

For me, it's the other way around. The computer doesn't write stories for me to
read and share as my own. I write stories to control the computer.
