When I was a teacher, I taught at a school for kids with special needs and
learning disabilities. The therapists would teach kids things like social cues.
I remember one time, they handed out social cues written on paper, things like
"I want to be friends" or "I'm not interested in this conversation" or "I am
busy and can't talk right now." Then the students would practice acting it out
with a partner, then they would do it in front of the class and the other
students would have to guess the social cue.

One student got "I am busy and can't talk right now" and part of the rules was
they couldn't directly say it. They had to act it out using social cues. So one
of the students in the pairs was acting it out, as if they were one of the
therapists or team members and the other student was asking to talk to them
right now. Here's how the conversation went:

"Hey, I really need to talk today. Can we talk right now? I really need help"

The person cueing looked at their watch and went "Uhhhh..."

"I can be quick, maybe if you just have 30 minutes we could talk?"

"Uhhh...well, I have to go do something else right now. I have a lot to do
today"

"Just ten minutes, then, I really need help right now."

"Well, I don't know..."

"I'll be quick."

"Ummm...well, I have a lot of stuff to do today..." then looking at her watch again and moving toward the door.

After this conversation, the students started guessing the social cue. One
student said "Manipulation, gaslighting. I just felt like the person was
manipulating the student. They just didn't seem honest."

And in fact, I actually saw it there way. I saw that the person was trying to
give the social cue "No, I can't talk," without actually saying it. But I see
the student's perspective. It could be viewed as manipulation. They were trying
to get the student to leave them alone without actually having to be honest with
the student and saying no. Social cues that are considered "normal" could easily
be considered manipulation. The "cue-er" is trying to get the result they want
without looking like the "bad guy" and having to say "no". They're trying to
avoid the dirty work of saying "no" because some people think saying "no" is
rude.

But saying no is not actually rude. It is honest and direct. Maybe it was the
therapist that needed to act out practicing saying "No, I'm too busy to talk
right now. I can schedule a time this week once I look at my calendar, and
you'll just have to wait until I have time. You could also solve it a different
way by finding someone else who has time to talk sooner. Maybe you could talk to
a teacher during lunch or a different team member." That would be an honest and
direct answer that doesn't leave the other person feeling like you're blowing
them off or trying to get out of your social responsibility of telling the
truth. It would also help the student by giving them an action of another way to
solve their problem so they could have more autonomy and solve it themselves
instead of stringing them along and giving them the idea that you might be able
to help them by not saying "no."
